Welcome to my website. I am a Data Scientist living and working in London (when Coronavirus is all done). This site is very much still a work in progress but I will use it to share some of my little hacks, projects and things I find interesting. Mostly this will be all things data-science!

The website is still being built so if you see a mistake let me know! ðŸ˜› If you're interested I am build the site using the hugo static site generator.
