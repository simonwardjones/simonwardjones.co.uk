summary: Simon Ward-Jones' personal website - all things data science 
---

Welcome to my website. I am a Data Scientist living and working in London. This site is always a work in progress but I will use it to share some of side projects and things I find interesting. Mostly this will be all things data-science!

The website is still being built (using HUGO static site generator) so if you see a mistake let me know!
